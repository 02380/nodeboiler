# nodeboiler
An ES6 Boilerplate configured with babel, webpack, eslint, and all the minify production code you need. It also outputs seperate JS and CSS, because I need wanted it.

## Usage
* `npm start` to run eslint on watch mode and dev-server at localhost:8080.
* `npm dev` for just a dev-server at localhost:8080.
* `npm run watch` to only watch for/recompile on changes.
* `npm run build` to generate a minified, production-ready build.
